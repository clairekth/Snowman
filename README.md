# Snowman

Master 1 Computer Science project aimed at creating a snowman in c++ starting from scratch using raymarching.

The constraints are:
-   The snowman must be created using only the standard library
-   The rendering time must be less than 1 hour

The snowballs making up the structure of the snowman use Brownian motion to create a more natural look.

We also used the smooth-union function to create a smooth transition between the snowballs and other shapes.
